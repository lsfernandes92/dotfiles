# karabiner-elements

`karabiner-elements` is a utility program installed via the `brew` package
manager. it's a powerful keyboard customizer.

I use it primarily to set up **hyper key** for **⇧⌃⌥⌘ (shift + control + option + command)**.

in conjunction with `raycast` (spotlight replacement), I use custom hotkeys to
make app switching easier and faster.

examples are:

**hyper key + o** = open obsidian

**hyper key + v** = open vscode

**hyper key + t** = open terminal

**hyper key + z** = open zen
